# INTRODUCTION

This program will take the application we created in Graphics Setup and teach you how to draw a simple red triangle to the screen. Basic drawing commands will be described and there will also be a brief introduction to both fragment and vertex shaders. No changes are needed to the Java side of the application, all the changes that happen are in the native side.
